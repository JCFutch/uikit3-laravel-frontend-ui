## UIKit3 Laravel Frontend UI
The purpose of this package is to install the UIKit3 framework in to the laravel/ui package.

## Motivation
I found that I like the UIKit framework a lot. I know there are others out there that use it and I wanted to give a way for user to add it to their Laravel projects..

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [UIKit](http://getuikit.com)
- [Laravel](http://laravel.com)

## Features
In Laravel 7, the scaffolding was moved to the laravel/ui package and the options for installing whatever framework I want is limited. Just wanted to make the process a little easier for myself and others who use UIKit.

## Installation
To install this package - you call it just like you would when installing any of the other presets.

<pre>php artisan ui uikit3</pre>

This will install all the necessary pieces of the frontend scaffolding.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
Since Laravel comes with Composer, we will be using it also. Please make sure it is installed in your development environment.

**Step 1** - <pre>composer require cartographr/uikit3-laravel-frontend-ui</pre>

**Step 2** - Once the package installs, make sure that it appears in your composer.json file in your Laravel project. If it doesn't, please submit an issue ticket.

**Step 3** - Once you verify it's in your composer.json file, it will install just like the other laravel ui packages. <pre>php artisan ui uikit3</pre>

**Step 4** - Once installed, you will be prompted on the CLI to run <pre>npm install && npm run dev</pre>
Once you do that, everything should be ready to go and UIKit should be installed in to your project.

Hope you enjoy it!
