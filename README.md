## UIKit3 Laravel Frontend UI
The purpose of this package is to install the UIKit3 framework in to the laravel/ui package.

## Motivation
I found that I like the UIKit framework a lot. I know there are others out there that use it and I wanted to give a way for user to add it to their Laravel projects..

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [UIKit](http://getuikit.com)

## Features
In Laravel 7, the scaffolding was moved to the laravel/ui package and the options for installing whatever framework I want is limited. Just wanted to make the process a little easier for myself and others who use UIKit.
